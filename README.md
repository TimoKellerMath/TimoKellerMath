I'm Timo Keller. I'm interested in (computational) arithmetic geometry.

Here is code for some articles I'm involved in on GitHub:
* https://github.com/davidlowryduda/isolated_points (Towards a Classification of Isolated j-invariants)
* https://github.com/TimoKellerMath/QuadraticPoints (Computing quadratic points on modular curves X_0(N))
* https://github.com/shiva-chid/Hyperelliptic_X0Nstarquotients (quadratic Chabauty for hyperelliptic X_0(N)^*)
* https://github.com/shiva-chid/ModularCurvesX0plusG4-6 (quadratic Chabauty for X_0(p)^+ of genus 4, 5, and 6)

Work in progress (MIT workshops https://math.mit.edu/~edgarc/MCW.html and https://math.mit.edu/~edgarc/MCW2.html on the LMFDB https://www.lmfdb.org):
