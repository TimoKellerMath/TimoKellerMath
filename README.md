I'm Timo Keller. I'm interested in (computational) arithmetic geometry.

Here is code for some articles I'm involved in on GitHub:
* https://github.com/shiva-chid/Hyperelliptic_X0Nstarquotients (quadratic Chabauty for hyperelliptic X_0(N)^*)
* https://github.com/shiva-chid/ModularCurvesX0plusG4-6 (quadratic Chabauty for X_0(p)^+ of genus 4, 5, and 6)
