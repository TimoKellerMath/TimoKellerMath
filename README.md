I'm Timo Keller. I'm interested in (computational) arithmetic geometry.

Here is code for some articles I'm involved in on GitHub:

**Birchâ€“Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture**

* https://github.com/TimoKellerMath/strongBSDgenus2 (Complete verification of strong BSD for many modular abelian surfaces over __Q__ https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07307 joint with Michael Stoll)

**Rational points on modular curves**

* https://github.com/sachihashimoto/X0Nstarquotients (Rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ when $N$ is non-squarefree, joint with Sachi Hashimoto and Samuel Le Fourn)
* https://github.com/davidlowryduda/isolated_points (Towards a Classification of Isolated _j_-invariants https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07740)
* https://github.com/TimoKellerMath/QuadraticPoints (Computing quadratic points on modular curves X_0(N) https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12566)
* https://github.com/shiva-chid/Hyperelliptic_X0Nstarquotients (quadratic Chabauty for hyperelliptic X_0(N)^* https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05541)

**Inverse Galois theory for 17T7**

* https://github.com/SamSchiavone/17T7 and https://github.com/edgarcosta/EichlerShimuraHMF (17T7 is a Galois group over the rationals https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07857, joint with Raymond van Bommel, Edgar Costa, Noam D. Elkies, Sam Schiavone, and John Voight)

**Work in progress** (MIT workshops https://math.mit.edu/~edgarc/MCW.html, https://math.mit.edu/~edgarc/MCW2.html and https://math.mit.edu/~edgarc/MCW3.html on the LMFDB https://www.lmfdb.org):
